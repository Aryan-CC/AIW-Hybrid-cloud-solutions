HOL-4: Exercise 1: Integrate Azure Stack HCI 22H2 with Azure
==============
Overview
-----------

   As part of the lab environment, we have already deployed the Azure Stack HCI 22H2 Cluster, so you don't have to deploy it and you can continue adding it to Windows Admin Center and verify the registration of the cluster within Azure to unlock the full functionality.

   Azure Stack HCI 22H2 is delivered as an Azure service and needs to register within 30 days of installation per the Azure Online Services Terms.  With our cluster configured, we'll now register your Azure Stack HCI 22H2 cluster with **Azure Arc** for monitoring, support, billing, and hybrid services. Upon registration, an Azure Resource Manager resource is created to represent each on-premises Azure Stack HCI 22H2 cluster, effectively extending the Azure management plane to Azure Stack HCI 22H2. Information is periodically synced between the Azure resource and the on-premises cluster.  One great aspect of Azure Stack HCI 22H2, is that the Azure Arc registration is a native capability of Azure Stack HCI 22H2, so there is no agent required.

## Task 0: Add the existing Cluster to Windows Admin Center

This Lab also includes a dedicated Windows Admin Center (WAC) gateway server. The WAC gateway server can be accessed by connecting to it from RDP. A shortcut is available on the HCIBox-Client desktop.

1. Open this shortcut and use the domain credential (username_supplied_at_deployment@jumpstart.local) to start an RDP session to the Windows Admin Center VM.

## Task 1: Verify your Azure Stack HCI 22H2 Cluster is registered with Azure

Normally registering your cluster can be done in 2 ways. You can use **Windows Admin Center**, or you can use **PowerShell**. **Within this lab the Azure Stack HCI 22H2 cluster is already registered.**

To verify the registration let's now use PoweShell.

We're going to perform the registration verification from the **AdminCenter** machine, which we've been using to access Windows Admin Center.

1. After logging in to the **AdminCenter** VM, click on the windows button and search for **PowerShell ISE** then right-click on it to select **Run as administrator**.

    ![Volume created on Azure Stack HCI 20H2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/hybridworkshop/main/media/powershell.png "Volume created on Azure Stack HCI 20H2")
    
2. With the Az.StackHCI modules installed, it's now time to register your Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster to Azure. However, first it's worth exploring how to check the existing registration status. The following code assumes you are still in the remote PowerShell session open from the previous commands.

     ```powershell
     Invoke-Command -ComputerName AzSHOST1 -ScriptBlock {
     Get-AzureStackHCI
     } 
     ```
     >Note: If you see the cluster registration status is showing as **Out of Policy**, you can ignore that as there will be no issue during the lab because of this. 
     
    ![Check the registration status of the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster](./media/HOL4-ex-01.png "Check the registration status of the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster")

As you can see from the result, the cluster is yet to be registered, and the cluster status identifies as **Clustered**. Azure Stack HCI 20H2 needs to register within 30 days of installation as per the Azure Online Services Terms. If it is not clustered within 30 days, the **ClusterStatus** will show **OutOfPolicy**, and if not registered within 30 days, the **RegistrationStatus** will show as **OutOfPolicy**.


3. Now copy the below code and paste it in your PowerShell window, replace ``*your-subscription-ID-here*`` with your subscription ID <inject key="Subscription ID" />. After updating the subscription ID, run the PowerShell commands to register your Azure Stack HCI 20H2 to Azure portal. 

   > **Note**: We have already updated the domain user name and password for the local host server. 
   
    ```powershell
     $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "demo!pass123" -AsPlainText -Force
     $azshciNodeCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("hybrid\azureuser", $password)

     Register-AzStackHCI `
    -SubscriptionId *your-subscription-ID-here* `
    -ResourceName "azshciclus" `
    -ResourceGroupName "HybridHost" `
    -Region "EastUS" `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureCloud" `
    -ComputerName "AZSHCINODE01.hybrid.local" `
    â€“Credential $azshciNodeCreds 
     
     ```

Many of these commands are optional:

* **-ResourceName** - If not declared, the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster name is used
* **-ResourceGroupName** - If not declared, the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster plus the suffix "-rg" is used
* **-Region** - If not declared, "EastUS" will be used.  Additional regions are supported, with the longer term goal to integrate with Azure Arc in all Azure regions.
* **-EnvironmentName** - If not declared, "AzureCloud" will be used, but allowed values will include additional environments in the future
* **-ComputerName** - This is used when running the commands remotely against a cluster.  Just make sure you're using a domain account that has admin privilege on the nodes and cluster
* **-Credential** - This is also used for running the commands remotely against a cluster.

**Register-AzureStackHCI** runs synchronously, with progress reporting, and typically takes 5-10 minutes.  The first time you run it, it may take slightly longer, because it needs to install some dependencies, including additional Azure PowerShell modules.

4. Once dependencies have been installed, you'll receive a popup on **HybridHost001** to authenticate to Azure. Provide your **Azure credentials**, which are declared in the Environment Details page.

    ![Login to Azure](./media/azure_login_reg.png "Login to Azure")

5. Once successfully authenticated, the registration process will begin and will take some time to finish. Once completed, you should see a message indicating success, as per below:

    ![Register Azure Stack HCI 20H2 with PowerShell](./media/registered.png "Register Azure Stack HCI 20H2 with PowerShell")

6. Once the cluster is registered, run the following command on **HybridHost001** to check the updated status:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName AZSHCINODE01 -ScriptBlock {
    Get-AzureStackHCI
    }
    ```
    ![Check updated registration status with PowerShell](./media/ps.png "Check updated registration status with PowerShell")

You can see the **ConnectionStatus** and **LastConnected** time, which is usually within the last day unless the cluster is temporarily disconnected from the Internet. An Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster can operate fully offline for up to 30 consecutive days.

## Task 2: View registration details in the Azure portal ###

Once the registration is complete, you should take some time to explore the artifacts that are created in Azure.

1. In the virtual machine (VM) on the left, click on the Azure portal desktop icon as shown below.

    ![azure portal](./media/azure%20portal.png)
    
1. On the **Sign in to Microsoft Azure** window, you will see the login screen, enter the following username and click on **Next**.

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex1-portalsignin-1.png?raw=true)

1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**. 

   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
   
   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex1-portalsignin-2.png?raw=true)

1. First time users are often prompted to **Stay Signed In**, if you see any such message, click on **No**

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex1-portalsignin-3.png?raw=true)

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue the lab.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** popup window appears, click **Maybe Later** to skip the tour.

1. You should see a new **Resource group** listed, with the name you specified earlier, which in our case, is **HybridHost** and click on it.

    ![Registration resource group in Azure](./media/rg.png "Registration resource group in Azure")

1. Under **HybridHost** resource group page, you'll see a resource **Azure Stack HCI** with the name **azshciclus** has been created.

    ![Registration resource group in Azure](./media/stack.png "Registration resource group in Azure")
    
   >**Note**: If you are not able to view the **Azure Stack HCI** resource with the name **azshciclus** in the HybridHost resource group. Please follow from step 9 - step 12 else skip to step 13.

1. In the virtual machine (VM) on the left, double-click on the **Windows Admin Center** .

    ![Allow popups in Edge](./media/wac.png "Allow popups in Edge")
    
1. On Windows Admin Center page, Select the **azshciclus.hybrid.local** cluster to open it.

    ![Allow popups in Edge](./media/hol4ss1.png "Allow popups in Edge")
    
1. Select **Settings** from the Tools side blade.

    ![Allow popups in Edge](./media/hol4ss2.png "Allow popups in Edge")
    
1. Select **Azure Stack HCI registration** under Azure Stack HCI and click on **View Azure resource**.

    ![Allow popups in Edge](./media/hol4ss3.png "Allow popups in Edge")

1. Click on the **azshciclus**, then you'll be taken to the new Azure Stack HCI Resource Provider, which shows information about all of your clusters, including details on the currently selected cluster.
