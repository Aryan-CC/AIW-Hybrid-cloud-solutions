# **Getting Started with Your  Hybrid Cloud Solution Hands On Lab**
 
Welcome to your Hybrid Cloud Solution(Azure Arc) Hands On Lab! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn about Azure services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience:

## Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview

Azure Arc is a solution that extends Azure's capabilities to manage and run applications and services across diverse environments such as datacenters, edge locations, and multicloud platforms. It provides a unified approach for developing, operating, and securing both new and existing applications using the same tools, security measures, and governance mechanisms available within the Azure ecosystem. Azure Arc enables you to utilize Azure servicesâ€”such as application management, data, and AIâ€”on existing hardware, virtualization platforms, Kubernetes clusters, IoT devices, and integrated systems.

## Objectives

- Explore how Contoso can simplify managing distributed IT systems using Azure Arc.
- Onboard on-premises virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and SQL servers to Azure Arc.
- Apply Azure governance policies, enable monitoring, and integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel.
- Deploy GitOps configurations and use Azure Policy for Kubernetes cluster management.
- Enable large-scale observability with Azure Monitor for Containers. 
- Deploy cloud-native SQL Managed Instances and PostgreSQL Hyperscale using the Azure Arc data controller on Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have: Basic knowledge and understanding of the following

- Basic understanding of Azure Kubernetes Service and managing workloads within them.
- Experience with Azure cloud services, including how to navigate the Azure portal.
- Basic knowledge Azure Arc.
- Knowledge of Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection and security monitoring.
- Basic knowledge of GitOps .
  
## Architecture Diagram

In the Azure Arc architecture, **Azure Arc** enables unified management for Contoso's on-premises **Windows** and **Linux VMs** and **Kubernetes clusters**. **Azure Policy** ensures governance and compliance, while **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** provides comprehensive security. **Azure Monitor** tracks performance and metrics, with **Azure Monitor for Containers** offering observability for Kubernetes clusters. **Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance** and **Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale** deliver scalable, cloud-native data management. **GitOps** manages Kubernetes configurations, and **Azure Data Controller** facilitates the deployment and management of data services. This setup simplifies operations and extends Azureâ€™s capabilities across Contoso's diverse IT environments.

## Explanation of Components

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** A managed Kubernetes service for running and managing containerized applications in the cloud.
- **Azure Arc:** Extends Azure management and governance to on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments.
- **Azure Monitor:** A unified monitoring service to track application and infrastructure performance.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud:** A cloud security solution that provides advanced threat protection for Azure and hybrid environments.
- **Microsoft Sentinel:** A scalable cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) tool for threat detection and response.
- **GitOps for Kubernetes:** An operational model that uses Git repositories as the source of truth for automated Kubernetes deployments.
- **Azure Data Services:** Cloud-native, managed services for SQL and PostgreSQL, available across hybrid environments with Azure Arc.


## Accessing Your Lab Environment
 
1. You can see a virtual machine desktop ðŸ’» (LabVM/ARCHOST) is loaded on the left side of your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab.
