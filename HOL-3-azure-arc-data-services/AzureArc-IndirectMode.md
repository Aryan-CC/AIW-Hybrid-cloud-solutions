# Exercise 10: Connecting to Azure Arc Data Controller and deploying Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance Business Critical in Indirect connectivity mode
In this exercise, you will be connecting to the pre-deployed Azure Arc Data Controller with indirect connectivity mode using Azure Data Studio.  we will also create an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance Business Critical on top of an Azure Arc Data Controller with indirect connectivity mode.

## Exercise Objectives

In this exercise, you will be performing the following tasks:

- Task 1: Connect to the Azure Arc data controller using Azure Data Studio.
- Task 2: Monitor with Data Controller Dashboard.
- Task 3: Create Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance.
- Task 4: Connect to Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance using Azure Data Studio.
- Task 5: View SQL MI resource and SQL MI logs in the Azure portal.
  

### Task 1: Connect to the Azure Arc data controller using Azure Data Studio.

Let us now connect to the Azure Arc data controller using Azure Data Studio.

In the environment provided, the Azure Arc Data controller is already deployed on top of the Kubernetes Cluster. We are using **Indirect** connectivity mode for the Azure Arc-enabled data services environment to Azure.
  
   > **Info**: There are multiple modes available to connect to Azure. if the Azure Arc-enabled data services are directly connected to Azure, users can use Azure Resource Manager APIs, the Azure CLI, and the Azure portal to operate the Azure Arc data services. The experience in directly connected mode is much like how you would use any other Azure service with provisioning/de-provisioning, scaling, configuring, and so on, all in the Azure portal.
   
   If you want to know more about this, refer to the [Connectivity Modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/data/connectivity)

1. Open **Windows PowerShell** from the Desktop and run the below command to delete the existing cluster context and create a new one to connect with the Azure Arc Data controller Indirect connectivity mode.

   ```BASH
   Remove-Item C:\Users\arcadmin\.kube\config
   ```
   
   ```BASH
   Import-AzAksCredential -ResourceGroupName $env:resourceGroup -Name $env:clusterName -Force
   ```
   
1. Navigate back to **Azure Data studio** and in **Azure Arc Controllers** section, click on **Connect to Existing Azure Arc Controller**.

   ![](./images/15-05-2024(3).png "Azure Data Studio")
   
1. In the **Connect to Existing Controller** page, provide the following details and click on **Connect**.

   - **Namespace**:
     ```BASH
     arcdc
     ```
   
   - **Cluster Context**:
     ```BASH
     Arc-Data-Demo
     ```

   - **Name** :
     ```BASH
     arcdc-indirect
     ```
   
     ![](./media/newindccnct.png "Connection")

1. Once the connection is successful, you can see the **arcdc-indirect** Azure Arc data controller listed under Azure Arc Controllers on the bottom left of the Azure Data Studio.

    ![](./media/indirectmode-3.png "")

### Task 2: Monitor with Data Controller Dashboard

Now that you are connected to an Azure Arc data controller, let us view the dashboards for the data controller and any SQL-managed instances or PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group resources that you have.

1. In the **Connections** panel, under **AZURE ARC CONTROLLERS**, right-click on the **arcdc-indirect** data controller and select **Manage**.

   > **Note**: You will see that there is no Azure Arc Resource. This is because you have not deployed any resources on the Azure Arc data services environment yet. You will be deploying the resources in the next exercises.

    ![](./media/indirectmode-4.png "")

1. Once you are in the Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard, you can see the following details about the data controller 

   - Name of the Arc Data Controller
   
   - Region where it is deployed

   - Connection mode

   - Resource Group

   - Subscription ID of the Azure Subscription

   - Controller Endpoint

   - Namespace
   
   You will also see that we have deployed using the Indirect connection mode of the Azure Arc Data controller.

   ![](./media/indirectmode-5.png "")
   
   > **Note**: If you click on the **Open in Azure portal** button from the menu on the top, you will not be able to find the resources because we have not yet uploaded any logs to the Azure portal and without uploading any logs to Azure, you will not be able to view the Azure Arc data controller resource in the Azure portal.

### Task 3: Create Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance

In this task, you will be creating an SQL Managed Instance using Azure Data Studio. Azure SQL Managed Instance is an intelligent and scalable cloud database service that combines the broadest SQL Server database engine compatibility with all the benefits of a fully managed and evergreen platform as a service.

1. Open **Azure Data Studio** from the desktop if not already opened. 
   > **Note**: Azure Data Studio is a free cross-platform database tool for data professionals using on-premises and cloud data platforms on Windows, macOS, and Linux

1. Now, right-click on the Azure Arc data controller connection, click on Manage, and then click on the **+ New Instance** button within the Azure Arc Data controller dashboard.
