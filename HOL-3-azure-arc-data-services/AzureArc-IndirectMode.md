# Exercise 2: Connecting Azure Data Controller and Azure Arc enabled SQLMI business critical in Indirect Mode using Azure Data Studio 

In this exercise, we will create an Azure SQL Managed Instance - Azure Arc in Indirect Mode and restore and migrate the database using multiple methods.

## Task 1: Connect to the data controller using Azure Data Studio.

Let us now connect to the data controller using Azure Data Studio.

In the environment provided, the Azure Arc Data controller is already deployed on to the Kubernetes Cluster. We are using **direct** connectivity mode for the Azure Arc enabled data services environment to Azure.
  
   > ***Info***: There are multiple modes available to connect to Azure. if the Azure Arc enabled data services are directly connected to Azure, users can use Azure Resource Manager APIs, the Azure CLI, and the Azure portal to operate the Azure Arc data services. The experience in directly connected mode is much like how you would use any other Azure service with provisioning/de-provisioning, scaling, configuring, and so on, all in the Azure portal.
   
   If you want to know more about this, refer to the [Connectivity Modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/data/connectivity)

1. Open **Windows PowerShell** from the Desktop and run the below command to switch the cluster context from **Direct to Indirect mode**.

   ```BASH
   kubectl config use-context Arc-Data-Demo
   ```
   ![](./media/cc-switch.png "Connection")

1. Navigate back to **Azure Data studio** and in the **Azure Arc Controllers** section, click on **Connect to Existing Azure Arc Controller**.

   ![](./media/indirectmode-1.png "Connection")
   
1. In the **Connect to Existing Controller** page, provide the following details and click on **Connect**.

   - **Namespace**:
     ```BASH
     arcdc
     ```
   
   - **Cluster Context**:
     ```BASH
     Arc-Data-Demo
     ```

   - **Name** :
     ```BASH
     arcdc-indirect
     ```
   
     ![](./media/indirectmode-2.png "Connection")

1. Once the connection is successful, you can see the **arcdc-indirect** Azure Arc data controller listed under Azure Arc Controllers on the bottom left of the Azure Data Studio.

    ![](./media/indirectmode-3.png "")

## Task 2: Monitor with Data Controller Dashboard

Now that you are connected to an Azure Arc data controller, let us view the dashboards for the data controller and any SQL managed instances or PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group resources that you have.

1. In the **Connections** panel, under **AZURE ARC CONTROLLERS**, right-click on the **arcdc-indirect** data controller and select **Manage**.

   > **Note**: You will see that there is no Azure Arc Resource. This is because you have not deployed any resource on the Azure Arc data services environment yet. You will be deploying the resources in the next exercises.

    ![](./media/indirectmode-4.png "")

1. Once you are in the Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard, you can see following details about the data controller 
   - Name of the Arc Data Controller
   - Region where it is deployed
   - Connection mode
   - Resource Group
   - Subscription ID of the Azure Subscription
   - Controller Endpoint
   - Namespace
   
   You will also see that we have deployed using the Indirect connection mode of the Azure Arc Data controller.

   ![](./media/indirectmode-5.png "")
   
   > **Note**: If you click on the **Open in Azure portal** button from the menu on the top, you will not be able to find the resources because we have not yet uploaded any logs to the Azure portal and without uploading any logs to Azure, you will not be able to view the Azure Arc data controller resource in the Azure portal.

## Task 3: Create Azure Arc enabled SQL Managed Instance

In this task, you will be creating an SQL Managed Instance using Azure Data Studio. Azure SQL Managed Instance is the intelligent and scalable cloud database service that combines the broadest SQL Server database engine compatibility with all the benefits of a fully managed and evergreen platform as a service.

1. On the JumpVM provided, launch the **Command Prompt** by double-clicking on the cmd shortcut on the desktop.
  
    ![](./images/azuredatastudio.png "azdata")

1. Once the command prompt window opens up, run the following command to create SQL MI instance.

   ```BASH
   az sql mi-arc create --name arcsql-indir --k8s-namespace arcdc --replicas 1 --cores-request "2" --cores-limit "4" --memory-request "4Gi" --memory-limit "8Gi" --storage-class-data "default" --storage-class-datalogs "default" --storage-class-logs "default" --volume-size-data 5Gi --volume-size-datalogs 5Gi --volume-size-logs 5Gi  --tier BusinessCritical --dev --license-type BasePrice --cores-limit 4 --use-k8s
   ```
   ![](./media/indirectmode-6.png "azdata")
   
   >**Note**: The SQL MI instance will take 5-10 minutes to create. Please wait until it gets created.

1. Once the Deployment of SQLMI is complete, navigate back to Azure data studio and in **Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard** under Azure Arc Resources you can see the newly created Azure Arc enabled Azure SQL Managed instance.

   ![](./media/indirectmode-7.png "azdata")

   > **Note**: You might have to right-click and refresh on Arc data controller to view the instance if you do not see one after seeing the text **arcsql is Ready** at the bottom of the notebook.

## Task 4: Connect to Azure Arc enabled SQL Managed Instance using Azure Data Studio.

In this task, you will learn how to connect to your newly created Azure Arc enabled Azure SQL Managed instance using Azure Data Studio.

1. If the **Command Prompt** window is not already opened, open a new one by clicking on the Command Prompt icon from the desktop shortcut and run the following command to create a new service for port 1533.

   ```BASH
   kubectl expose pod arcsql-indir-0 -n arcdc --port=1533 --type=LoadBalancer --name=sqlconnection
   ```
   ![](./media/indirectmode-8.png "azdata")
      
   >**Note**: This command will create a new service which will be used to connect to the SQL MI instance directly.

1. You can now run the below command to check the service creation. It might take 2-5 minutes for the external IP to appear. Copy the external IP for later use.

   ```BASH
   kubectl get svc -n arcdc
   ```
   
   ![](./media/indirectmode-9.png "azdata")
   
   >**Note**: Retry the running command multiple times until the external IP is visible.

1. Copy the external IP and add **,1533** to the end of the external IP.

   ```BASH
   <external IP>,1533
   ```

1. In Azure Data Studio, in the connections tab within the servers, click on **Add Connection**.

   ![](images/sql-instance4.png "Confirm")

1. Enter the following in the connection details page:

    - **Connection type** : Select **Microsoft SQL Server** **(1)**
   
    - **Sever**: Paste the external endpoint value of SQL Managed Instance which you copied earlier **(2)**

      >**Note**: Make sure you have entered **IP Address** with **port number**.
   
    - **Authentication type** : Select **SQL Login** from the drop down options **(3)**
   
    - **User name** : Enter arcuser **(4)**
      ```BASH
      arcuser
      ```
   
    - **Password** : Enter Password.1!! **(5)**
      ```BASH
      Password.1!!
      ```
    
    - Click on **Connect** **(6)**
   
   ![](./media/indirectmode-10.png "azdata")
   
1. You are now successfully connected with your Azure Arc enabled SQL MI Server. You can see it under servers. You can explore the SQL Managed Instance - Azure Arc Dashboard to view the databases and run a query.
